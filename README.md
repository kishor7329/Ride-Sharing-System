## 🔄 System Flowchart

![Flowchart](rideshare_system_flowchart.svg)

## 📖 Flow Description

### 1. User Registration / Login

1. A new visitor lands on **register.html** and submits their details via **register.php**, which hashes the password and inserts a row into the `users` table.
2. Returning users go directly to **login.html**. Credentials are checked in **login.php**; on success a session is created and the user is redirected to **dashboard.php**.
3. Failed logins redirect back to the login form.

### 2. Ride Booking

1. From **dashboard.php**, the user navigates to **book_ride.html** and enters pickup location, drop-off, and ride type.
2. **book_ride.php** checks for available drivers. If none are found, the user is notified and can retry.
3. On success, a new row is inserted into the `rides` table with `status = pending`.

### 3. Driver Accepting a Ride

1. **driver_panel.php** queries pending rides and presents them to the driver.
2. The driver clicks "Accept" which calls **accept_ride.php**, updating `status = accepted` and linking the driver to the ride.
3. If the driver declines or skips, the ride remains pending for the next driver.

### 4. Ride Status Updates

| Step         | File                    | Status Change            |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Accept ride  | `accept_ride.php`       | `pending → accepted`     |
| Start trip   | `update_ride_status.php`| `accepted → ongoing`     |
| End trip     | `update_ride_status.php`| `ongoing → completed`    |

### 5. Ride Completion

1. On completion, fare is calculated and a debit entry is created in the `wallet` table.
2. The ride appears in **view_rides.php** under the user's history.

### 6. Rating & Review

1. After a completed ride, the user is prompted in **rate_ride.php** to submit a 1–5 star rating and an optional comment.
2. The review is saved to the `reviews` table and the driver's average rating in `drivers` is updated.
3. The user can then visit **profile.php** or return to the dashboard for another booking.

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Passwords are stored using `password_hash()` with `PASSWORD_BCRYPT`
- All user input should be sanitized using `mysqli_real_escape_string()` or prepared statements
- Session tokens are regenerated on login to prevent session fixation
- Role-based access: driver-only pages check session role before rendering
- HTTPS is strongly recommended in production
